# **Sophie Faircloth**

## Research Assistant and Student at the University of Pennsylvania

I'm a student at the University of Pennsylvania working towards my Bachelors and Masters in Linguistics with a minor in Psychology. 

I currently work as a research assistant in the Cultural Evolution of Language lab with [Dr. Gareth Roberts](https://www.drgarethroberts.com), working on an independent research project with Inthat Boonpongmanee on the interpretation of sudden complexification and redundacy in novel language communication.

I'm a transcriber for the [Linguistic Data Consortium](https://www.ldc.upenn.edu).

I'm also a research assistant in the Goodwin lab with Dr. Geoffrey Goodwin and a senior research assistant in the Wellbeing and Morality lab with Dr. Jessie Sun.

Here is my [CV](https://acrobat.adobe.com/link/track?uri=urn:aaid:scds:US:e7bb674d-5b82-4594-af3e-d943576e8d40).
