<p>I want you to submit your assignment as a PDF, so I can keep a record of what the code looked like that day. I also want you to include your answers on your personal GitHub website. This will be good practice for editing your website and it will help you produce something you can keep after the class is over.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Download the Assignment1.Rmd file from Canvas. You can use this as a template for writing your answers. It’s the same as what you can see on my website in the Assignments tab. Once we’re done with this I’ll edit the text on the website to include the solutions.</p></li>
<li><p>On RStudio, open a new R script in RStudio (File &gt; New File &gt; R Script). This is where you can test out your R code. You’ll write your R commands and draw plots here.</p></li>
<li><p>Once you have finalized your code, copy and paste your results into this template (Assignment 1.Rmd). For example, if you produced a plot as the solution to one of the problems, you can copy and paste the R code in R markdown by using the <code>``{r} ```</code> command. Answer the questions in full sentences and Save.</p></li>
<li><p>Produce a PDF file with your answers. To do this, knit to PDF (use Knit button at the top of RStudio), locate the PDF file in your docs folder (it’s in the same folder as the Rproj), and submit that on on Canvas in Assignment 1.</p></li>
<li><p>Build Website, go to GitHub desktop, commit and push. Now your solutions should be on your website as well.</p></li>

<h1>Assignment 1</h1>
<p><em>This assignment is due on Canvas on Monday 9/20 before class, at 10:15 am. Include the name of anyone with whom you collaborated at the top of the assignment.</em></p>
<div id="problem-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Problem 1</h3>
<p><em>Install the datasets package on the console below using <code>install.packages("datasets")</code>. Now load the library.</em></p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(datasets)</code></pre>
<p><em>Load the USArrests dataset and rename it <code>dat</code>. Note that this dataset comes with R, in the package datasets, so there’s no need to load data from your computer. Why is it useful to rename the dataset?</em></p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Well, we want to replicate analyses. That’s why it’s nice to rename data.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>dat &lt;- USArrests</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="problem-2" class="section level3">
<h3>Problem 2</h3>
<p><em>Use this command to make the state names into a new variable called State. </em></p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(dplyr)
dat$state &lt;- tolower(rownames(USArrests))</code></pre>
<p><em>I used the dplyr package in order to rename this variable. I am sure there are other ways to do this but I used old reliable!</em></p>
<p><em>This dataset has the state names as row names, so we just want to make them into a new variable. We also make them all lower case, because that will help us draw a map later - the map function requires the states to be lower case.</em></p>
<p><em>List the variables contained in the dataset <code>USArrests</code>.</em></p>
<pre class="r"><code>names(dat)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;Murder&quot;   &quot;Assault&quot;  &quot;UrbanPop&quot; &quot;Rape&quot;     &quot;state&quot;</code></pre>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: The four variables are Murder, Assault, UrbanPop, and Rape.</p>
</div>
<div id="problem-3" class="section level3">
<h3>Problem 3</h3>
<p><em>What type of variable (from the DVB chapter) is <code>Murder</code>? </em> <strong>Answer</strong>: quantitative variable</p>
<p><em>What R Type of variable is it?</em></p>
<pre class="r"><code>typeof(dat$Murder)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;double&quot;</code></pre>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: double</p>
</div>
<div id="problem-4" class="section level3">
<h3>Problem 4</h3>
<p><em>What information is contained in this dataset, in general? What do the numbers mean? </em></p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: The information in this dataset is a set of the number of arrests for different violent crimes in the United States, as divided by state. The numbers represent the numeric value of arrests per 100,000 residents for assault, murder, and rape in each of the 50 US states, also providing the percent of the population living in urban areas (UrbanPop).</p>
</div>
<div id="problem-5" class="section level3">
<h3>Problem 5</h3>
<p><em>Draw a histogram of <code>Murder</code> with proper labels and title.</em></p>
<pre class="r"><code>hist(dat$Murder, col = &#39;red&#39;, ylab = &#39;Frequency&#39;, xlab = &#39;Murder Arrests per 100,000 residents&#39;, main = &#39;Histogram of Murder Arrests in the US&#39;, sub = &#39;(by state)&#39;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="Assignments_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="672" /></p>
</div>
<div id="problem-6" class="section level3">
<h3>Problem 6</h3>
<p><em>Please summarize <code>Murder</code> quantitatively. What are its mean and median? What is the difference between mean and median? What is a quartile, and why do you think R gives you the 1st Qu. and 3rd Qu.?</em></p>
<pre class="r"><code>summary(dat$Murder)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
##   0.800   4.075   7.250   7.788  11.250  17.400</code></pre>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: The mean of the Murder variable is 7.788 (murder arrests per 100,000 residents of a state). The median is 7.250 (murder arrests per 100,000 residents of a state). The difference between these two values quantitatively is 0.538. The difference qualitatively is that the mean represents the average number of murder arrests per 100,000 residents of all US states while the median is the middle value of the data set, showing the data has a slight right skew. A quartile isdivides the dataset into four parts, with Q1 being the median of the lower half of the dataset and Q3 being the median of the upper half of the data set. R gives you this information because quartiles can be helpful in determining where a specific data point falls in the set; for example, if a value for “Murders” is greater than Q3, 11.250, we can more reasonably assume that this state has an exceptionally high murder rate in comparison to other states in the US. If a state has a value for “Murders” that is less than 4.075, we can more reasonably assume that this state is relatively safer than other US states!</p>

<p><em>What does the command par do, in your own words (you can look this up by asking R <code>?par</code>)?</em></p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: The par function allows an R user to look at the graphical parameters that control how graphs are displayed. In the case of the par(mfrow=c(3,1)) function, we are able to not only look at the graphical parameters, but control them so that we can decide how many subplots we want displayed.</p>
<p><em>What can you learn from plotting the histograms together?</em></p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: From plotting the histograms together, we can view a comparison of the distributions in relation to each other, examining skew and quartile arrangement to see how distributions vary by crime type. On a more general note, plotting the histograms together allows us to see generally how frequency and distribution relationships among multiple variables interact, allowing a viewer a more clear image of the relationship between variables while still being able to view a more individualistic look at each histogram.</p>

<h3>Problem 8</h3>
<p><em>In the console below (not in text), type <code>install.packages("maps")</code> and press Enter, and then type <code>install.packages("ggplot2")</code> and press Enter. This will install the packages so you can load the libraries.</em></p>
<p><em>Run this code:</em></p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(maps) 
library(ggplot2) 

ggplot(dat, aes(map_id=state, fill=Murder)) + 
  geom_map(map=map_data(&quot;state&quot;)) + 
  expand_limits(x=map_data(&quot;state&quot;)$long, y=map_data(&quot;state&quot;)$lat)</code></pre>
<p><img src="Assignments_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="720" /></p>
<p><em>What does this code do? Explain what each line is doing.</em></p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: ggplot is the most basic implementation of any data visualization in R. In this instance, the first line of code is filling out the basic information of the data visual by specifying the variables which are involved in the plot. The second line of code employs the maps package and ggplot2 package to choose specifically to create a mapping of the selected variables, using states as the selected implementation of the map. The third line employs the expand_limit function in order to ensure that the limits of the visualization include a single value for all aspects of the plot, implying what should be included in the scale.</p>

<li>The distribution of sexual attraction is highly populated by those who identified (via the codebook) as only being attracted to the opposite gender.</li>
<li>A smaller number of women identify as being heterosexual than men, thought this could be slightly biased due to a smaller sample size of women. ## Problem 6: English speaking</li>
</ul>
<p>What does the distribution of English speaking look like in the sample? Is this what you might expect for a random sample of the US population? summary(dat<span class="math inline">\(speakengl) table(dat\)</span>speakengl) - Majority of the sample are English speakers, with 169 of the 171 respondents self-identifying as speaking English well or very well and only two respondents not speaking English well. - This is not what I would expect from a random sample of the US, but makes sense in the fact that this is a survey administered in English, probably leading to some sampling bias in a high yield of English speakers. Are there more English speaker females or males?</p>

<p><strong>The distribution shows a right skew to the ages of victims in recorded fatal shootings. I feel like this is fairly predictable, as the average age in the US is 38, and we know that fatal shootings often occur in over-policed low-income areas where the majority of people who are out and about are the working class of these areas, putting majority of their ages around 20-40 years old.</strong></p>

<p><strong>I would use the median of the data. Because the data is skewed, the median is a better measure of central tendency than the mean as it is more representative of the sample given what we know about it’s distribution. The median is 35, as in 35 years old is the average age of someone involved in a fatal shooting in the United States at the hand of police.</strong></p>

<p><strong>I do find this surprising. Given that there is a fairly predictable distribution of ages in this data set, you would assume there be an equally as predictable distribution of gender. However, knowing what we know about fatal shootings by police in the United States, the narrative portrayed by police officers often follows the line of not-being-confident-in-a-lack-of-threat-from-the-victim. While this narrative is incredibly frustrating, it does align with the uneven distribution of men and women in this event because women often are portrayed as being a lower threat level than men in general.</strong></p>

<li>Describe the relationship between the variables “body camera” and “flee” using a stacked barplot. What can you conclude from this relationship?</li>

<p><strong>Unfortunately, the reach of the police department is seen in the representation of police killings in reportings. Because an accurate report of fatal shootings at the hands of police relies on a pure and fully not corrupted police force and governmental power, there would be several levels of responsibility that would have to be upheld to ensure that all incidents of fatal shootings by police would be reported accurately.

<p>This is a dataset from a textbook by Brian S. Everitt about crime in the US in 1960. The data originate from the Uniform Crime Report of the FBI and other government sources. The data for 47 states of the USA are given.</p>
<p>Here is the codebook:</p>
<p>R: Crime rate: # of offenses reported to police per million population</p>
<p>Age: The number of males of age 14-24 per 1000 population</p>
<p>S: Indicator variable for Southern states (0 = No, 1 = Yes)</p>
<p>Ed: Mean of years of schooling x 10 for persons of age 25 or older</p>
<p>Ex0: 1960 per capita expenditure on police by state and local government</p>
<p>Ex1: 1959 per capita expenditure on police by state and local government</p>
<p>LF: Labor force participation rate per 1000 civilian urban males age 14-24</p>
<p>M: The number of males per 1000 females</p>
<p>N: State population size in hundred thousands</p>
<p>NW: The number of non-whites per 1000 population</p>
<p>U1: Unemployment rate of urban males per 1000 of age 14-24</p>
<p>U2: Unemployment rate of urban males per 1000 of age 35-39</p>
<p>W: Median value of transferable goods and assets or family income in tens of $</p>
<p>X: The number of families per 1000 earning below 1/2 the median income</p>
<p>We are interested in checking whether the reported crime rate (# of offenses reported to police per million population) and the average education (mean number of years of schooling for persons of age 25 or older) are related.</p>
